# 3DGraphicsEngine
raycasting with 3d graphics implementation
 i use the command 'g++ -o myprogram raycaster.cpp -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lSDL2' to compile

 crashes randomly atm, will fix eventually. the minimap is also there, but i created it just to show off some of the maths and graphics rendering which i thought looked cool. so not polishing.
